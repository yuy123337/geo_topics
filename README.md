Reasons why failed:
The main issue I faced was data sparsity and problems with my initial data, which significantly impacted my ability to properly evaluate Chinatown and non-Chinatown areas. This led to the need to rescrape all the data and fix the scraping code.

When I started, my scraping process was based on fixed geographic boundaries for cities, but this resulted in a dataset that was misaligned. For example, New York’s data was skewed toward Canadian regions, which was clearly wrong, but I didn't find out until I used the longtitude and latitude column. I looked up for the New York city Chinatown. When I tried to separate Chinatown restaurants from the rest in the same city, I realized that large parts of the data were missing, especially restaurant reviews in key areas. New York, in particular, had a massive number of reviews, but even with that, I couldn’t get the balance I needed to compare just two immigrant cuisines.

The scraping script ran on Google Colab, and the large file sizes and volume of data caused memory overflows, which led the script to crash repeatedly. What was originally expected to take about an hour stretched to 10 more hours, and eventually, it ended with errors. The process extended over several days, with errors occurring at every attempt, often requiring me to restart the process. With less sparse data, it took an extremely long time to run. For Chicago, in particular, the script didn’t distinguish between the city’s core metropolitan area and suburban areas, leading to all the reviews surrounding Chicago due to my sparse way of selecting. Another reason for the delays was that I started the geospatial trial too late. I could have identified the problem earlier, but I didn’t. This was my own mistake.

Plan
After addressing the data problem, I plan to start by analyzing the restaurant distribution in each city, ensuring the data between Chinatown and non-Chinatown restaurant reviews is balanced. Once the dataset is balanced, I will apply topic modeling and clustering techniques to assess whether the perception of authenticity and ethnic identity differs between Chinatown and non-Chinatown restaurants. Anderson’s (1987) analysis of Chinatown as an "imaginative geography" illustrates how racialized spatial categories institutionalize cultural distinctions. These frameworks emphasize that spatial and linguistic markers are not neutral but deeply embedded in historical, social, and political hierarchies. Song and Kim’s (2022) findings further demonstrate that variables such as restaurant history and independent ownership strongly influence perceptions of authenticity, while location plays a nuanced role. They argue that authenticity cues strategically employed in mainstream neighborhoods can blur the differences between ethnic enclave restaurants and their suburban counterparts. Signs like "authentic," "traditional," and "exotic" play a crucial role in reinforcing cultural identities, creating narratives that naturalize hierarchy and otherness. Topic modeling is a useful method for detecting diversity in reviews, as it identifies latent topics across large text datasets. The probability distribution over topics generated from this method will serve as independent variables in a regression model. I will then use these variables, along with topic diversity, to analyze consumer perceptions of each cuisine.

Methods
Luan (2022) used a combination of socioeconomic variables (e.g., GDP, urbanization, population size) and spatial factors (e.g., road network density, geographical distance) to understand spatial inequality. For my study on Chinatown and non-Chinatown restaurant reviews, the focus will be on how cultural factors (e.g., ethnicity-related terms and authenticity) are perceived differently in these areas. Since Chinatown is already an established cultural enclave, my primary aim will be to study the differences in perceptions of authenticity and ethnic identity in Chinatown versus non-Chinatown. 

Wang et al. (2023) developed a GIS-based framework to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on the restaurant industry. Their approach involved collecting datasets from multiple sources, such as SafeGraph, to analyze restaurant visitations. The study used spatial statistics, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, to explore relationships between neighborhood factors (e.g., income, population) and restaurant visitations. Spatial Lag Models (SLM) were applied to address spatial autocorrelation and improve model accuracy. This allowed the researchers to analyze how regional characteristics, including socioeconomic and spatial factors, impacted restaurant operations during the pandemic. In my case, I can apply spatial models like OLS and SLM to understand how factors like neighborhood income affect the reviews restaurants receive. This will help identify patterns indicating if certain cultural framing is more salient among certain demographics (e.g., different authenticity judge on Chinese and Japanese cuisine).

To further explore how these cultural factors influence consumer perceptions across the city, I plan to use GeoDa to check for spatial autocorrelation and clustering of reviews. This will help reveal whether geographic location influences how authenticity and ethnicity are framed in reviews. In this context, I will focus on cultural factors, such as the frequency of mentions of authenticity, ethnicity, and negative framing in reviews. These factors will act as independent variables in my analysis.
